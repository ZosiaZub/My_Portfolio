Google UX Design course from Coursera

Currently I am doing Google UX Design course, where I learn everything about the user experience, the design, the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines).
At the end of the course I will have done two projects (mobile app and web app), I will have knowledge about UX Research, wireframing, prototyping, I will know
how to use Figma and Adobe XD.

Unreal Engine

In the summer of 2022 I had opportunity to take part in the 3D course in Unreal Engine, which was organized by the international student organization - BEST (Board of European Students of Technology).
We did to projects. The first one was to creat a room, the second one was to create a game from ready-made elements (like trees, castle elements etc.).

Facebook posts for European BEST Engineering Competition

In this folder you can find Facebook posts I created in Illustartor and Canva (I used some reade-made elements from Canva, too), as I was the coordinator of
public relations online and graphics at the competition. I was responsible for our Facebook fanpage (https://www.facebook.com/ebec.wroclaw).
